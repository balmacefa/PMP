# Project-Scope-Statement

## A. Project Justification

It's been a while since I have engaged in new hobbies. I've been looking for finding a new hobby that will allow me to learn a new skill set while enjoying the end product.

---

## B. Project Scope

The boat will be radio controlled, can be sailed in various weather conditions, to be completed with a budget of less than USD 2,000 in 2 months (8 weekends). It will need to be fiberglass laminated for durability and weigh less than 10 kilos for easy transportation. The mast will need to fit in the car. Hydrodynamics of the original IMOCA 60 design will need to be altered to factor in scaling down so will the keel weight as a result of additional volume. Project Exclusion: Making the sails. Sails will be bought from a reputable sail maker.

---

## C. Project Deliverables

- Completion of the frame
- Laminated hull and deck
- Painted hull and deck
- Rig assembled

---

## D. Project Success Criteria

Finished in less than 8 weekends
Within the budget of USD 2,000
Needs to float (!)
Needs to sail stable
Radio control needs to operate within 100 metres of distance and for 2 hours without recharge.

1. Business Case

- I have been in search for a new fun project. I'd like a project not only fun to build but also enjoy the final product once finished.

- Building an Radio Controlled sailboat that I can sail over the weekends both in lakes and in sea conditions serve that objective.
  In addition, it will equip me with new skills, including; design of hydrodynamics, etc.

- Now, you need to give more details to the business case. Back it with research data if you can. Include interviews, subject matter expert opinions, and data to further justify your business case.

---

2. Project Objectives

- Create a radio controlled Imoca 60 replica, can be sailed in sea but also in lakes. It needs to be easy to transport and easy to assemble on the beach.

---

3. Major Deliverables

- The hull, the deck, the mast, the keel, the rudder, the radio control unit and the sails.

---

4. Roles & Responsibilities

- Fabián Balmaceda Rescia: Project Manager, designer, builder, sailor.
- My wife: Assistant project manager, assistant designer, assistant builder, assistant sailor.
